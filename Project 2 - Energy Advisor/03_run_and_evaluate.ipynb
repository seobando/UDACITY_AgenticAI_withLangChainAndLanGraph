      "To minimize costs and maximize solar power when charging your electric car tomorrow (October 7, 2023), here are the key insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solar Power Generation\n",
      "- **Peak Solar Generation**: The solar irradiance data indicates that the best solar generation will occur between **10 AM and 3 PM**. The highest solar irradiance is expected at **1 PM** with a value of **614.1 W/m²**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Electricity Pricing\n",
      "- **Off-Peak Rates**: The off-peak rates are significantly lower than peak rates. Here are the relevant rates:\n",
      "  - **Off-Peak (Midnight to 6 AM)**: Rates range from **$0.1105 to $0.1295**.\n",
      "  - **Peak (6 AM to 7 PM)**: Rates are higher, peaking at **$0.2494 at 5 PM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Charge During Peak Solar Hours**: \n",
      "   - **Best Time to Charge**: **10 AM to 3 PM**. This is when solar generation is at its highest, allowing you to utilize solar power for charging your electric car.\n",
      "   - **Optimal Hour**: Start charging around **10 AM** to take advantage of the increasing solar generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider Off-Peak Charging**: \n",
      "   - If you need to charge outside of solar hours, consider charging during the **off-peak hours** (before 6 AM or after 10 PM) to minimize costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "- **Charge your electric car from 10 AM to 3 PM** to maximize solar power usage.\n",
      "- If charging outside of these hours, opt for off-peak times to save on electricity costs.\n",

This will help you utilize the solar energy generated during these hours.\\n\\n2. **Charge Electric Vehicles (EVs)**:\\n   - If you have an EV, consider charging it during the **daytime**, especially between **10 AM and 2 PM** when solar generation is high. This will reduce reliance on grid electricity and maximize solar usage.\\n\\n3. **Avoid High Energy Usage During Peak Pricing**:\\n   - Try to limit energy-intensive activities during the **early morning (6 AM - 9 AM)** and **late afternoon (4 PM - 7 PM)** when electricity rates are higher.\\n\\n4. **Consider Battery Storage**:\\n   - If you have a battery storage system, charge it during the day using solar power and use it during the evening when electricity rates are higher.\\n\\n5. **Monitor Solar Generation**:\\n   - Keep an eye on your solar generation throughout the day to adjust your energy usage accordingly. If you notice high generation, you can run more appliances.\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, you can maximize your solar power usage, reduce your electricity costs, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 534, 'prompt_tokens': 3722, 'total_tokens': 4256, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 2816}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_560af6e559', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d9bb4b7c-08af-424c-9ef3-2b56d79833f8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3722, 'output_tokens': 534, 'total_tokens': 4256})]},\n",

       "    AIMessage(content=\"Here's a comprehensive energy optimization plan for the next three days in San Francisco, CA, considering the weather forecast and time-of-use electricity pricing.\\n\\n### Weather Forecast Overview\\n- **Day 1 (Today)**: Sunny with high temperatures around 24°C (75°F). Good solar generation expected.\\n- **Day 2**: Similar sunny conditions with temperatures reaching up to 27°C (81°F). Excellent solar generation.\\n- **Day 3**: Partly cloudy with temperatures around 23°C (73°F). Solar generation may be slightly reduced.\\n\\n### Electricity Pricing Overview\\n- **Peak Hours**: 6 AM - 8 PM (Rates range from $0.1714 to $0.2413 per kWh)\\n- **Off-Peak Hours**: 12 AM - 6 AM and 8 PM - 12 AM (Rates range from $0.1119 to $0.1249 per kWh)\\n\\n### Optimization Plan\\n\\n#### Day 1 (Today)\\n- **Morning (6 AM - 9 AM)**: \\n  - **Action**: Run high-energy appliances (e.g., dishwasher, laundry) during off-peak hours (12 AM - 6 AM) if possible. \\n  - **Solar Generation**: Start using solar power from 7 AM when irradiance begins to rise.\\n  \\n- **Midday (10 AM - 2 PM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Maximize solar usage by running energy-intensive devices (e.g., HVAC, pool pump) during peak solar hours (10 AM - 2 PM).\\n  - **Tip**: Set your thermostat to a higher temperature to reduce HVAC load.\\n\\n- **Afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Continue using solar power for any remaining high-energy tasks. \\n  - **Tip**: Avoid using heavy appliances during peak pricing hours (3 PM - 8 PM).\\n\\n- **Evening (6 PM - 12 AM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Shift to off-peak usage after 8 PM for any remaining energy needs.\\n\\n#### Day 2\\n- **Morning (6 AM - 9 AM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Similar to Day 1, run appliances during off-peak hours if possible.\\n\\n- **Midday (10 AM - 2 PM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Utilize solar power for all high-energy tasks. Consider running the dishwasher or laundry during this time.\\n\\n- **Afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Limit energy usage during peak pricing hours. Use solar power as much as possible.\\n\\n- **Evening (6 PM - 12 AM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Use off-peak rates for any remaining energy needs.\\n\\n#### Day 3\\n- **Morning (6 AM - 9 AM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Continue to run appliances during off-peak hours.\\n\\n- **Midday (10 AM - 2 PM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Use solar power for energy-intensive tasks. Expect slightly reduced solar generation due to partly cloudy conditions.\\n\\n- **Afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Limit energy usage during peak pricing hours.\\n\\n- **Evening (6 PM - 12 AM)**:\\n  - **Action**: Use off-peak rates for any remaining energy needs.\\n\\n### Additional Recommendations\\n- **Monitor Solar Generation**: Keep an eye on solar generation data to adjust your usage accordingly.\\n- **Energy-Efficient Practices**: Consider implementing energy-saving tips such as using LED bulbs, unplugging devices when not in use, and optimizing HVAC settings.\\n\\nBy following this plan, you can maximize your solar energy usage, minimize electricity costs, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future.
