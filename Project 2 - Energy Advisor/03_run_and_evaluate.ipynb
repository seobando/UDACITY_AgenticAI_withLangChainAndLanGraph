      "- **Solar Generation**: The solar irradiance is expected to be highest between **11 AM and 3 PM**. This is when solar power generation will be at its peak.\n",
      "- **Electricity Pricing**: The time-of-use pricing indicates that off-peak rates are available from **12 AM to 6 AM** and **after 10 PM**. Peak rates are in effect from **6 AM to 8 PM**.\n",

      "### Recommended Charging Times:\n",
      "1. **Charge During Peak Solar Generation**:\n",
      "   - **Best Time**: **11 AM to 3 PM**\n",
      "   - During this time, you can utilize solar power to charge your electric car, which is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **If Charging at Night**:\n",
      "   - **Best Time**: **12 AM to 6 AM** (off-peak rates)\n",
      "   - This is the cheapest time to charge if you cannot charge during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Recommendations:\n",
      "- **Charge your electric car between 11 AM and 3 PM** to take advantage of solar power.\n",
      "- If you miss this window, consider charging overnight from **12 AM to 6 AM** to benefit from lower electricity rates.\n",

Schedule high-energy activities (like running appliances, charging electric vehicles, etc.) during this window to maximize solar usage.\\n\\n2. **Avoid High Energy Use During Peak Pricing**:\\n   - **Peak Pricing Hours**: 6 AM - 7 PM. Try to limit energy-intensive activities during these hours if they cannot be powered by solar.\\n\\n3. **Charge Electric Vehicles (EVs)**:\\n   - If you have an EV, consider charging it during the peak solar generation hours (10 AM - 2 PM) to utilize solar energy and avoid peak pricing.\\n\\n4. **Shift Energy-Intensive Tasks**:\\n   - If possible, shift tasks like laundry or dishwashing to the morning before 10 AM or after 2 PM to avoid peak pricing and utilize solar energy.\\n\\n5. **Monitor Solar Generation**:\\n   - Keep an eye on your solar generation throughout the day. If you notice a significant drop in generation, adjust your energy usage accordingly.\\n\\n### Summary\\n- **Optimal Solar Usage**: 10 AM - 2 PM\\n- **Avoid High Usage**: 6 AM - 7 PM unless using solar power\\n- **Charge EVs**: During peak solar hours\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, you can maximize your solar energy usage and minimize your electricity costs.
