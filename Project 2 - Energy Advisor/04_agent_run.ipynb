            "- **Morning (7 AM - 12 PM)**: Solar irradiance starts low but increases significantly by 8 AM, peaking around 10 AM with about 273.36 W/m².\n",
            "- **Afternoon (1 PM - 4 PM)**: Solar irradiance remains high, peaking at 279.78 W/m² around 1 PM.\n",

            "1. **Schedule Energy-Intensive Activities During Peak Solar Hours**:\n",
            "   - **Run appliances** (like dishwashers, washing machines, etc.) between **10 AM and 2 PM** when solar generation is at its peak. This will help you utilize solar energy directly and reduce reliance on the grid.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Charge Electric Vehicles (EVs)**:\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Avoid High Energy Usage During Peak Pricing**:\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **Use Off-Peak Hours for Non-Solar Activities**:\n",
            "   - Schedule any non-essential energy use (like running heavy appliances) during off-peak hours (after 8 PM) to take advantage of lower rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Monitor Solar Generation**:\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Regular Maintenance**: Change air filters monthly to ensure better airflow and clean outdoor condenser coils annually. This helps your HVAC system operate more efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Seal Air Leaks**: Use weatherstripping or caulk to seal air leaks around windows and doors. This prevents conditioned air from escaping and reduces the workload on your HVAC system.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Insulation**: Add insulation to attics and walls to minimize heating and cooling needs. Proper insulation can significantly reduce energy consumption.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Use Ceiling Fans**: Ceiling fans can help circulate air, making rooms feel cooler. This allows you to raise the thermostat temperature by about 4°F without discomfort.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Plant Trees or Install Awnings**: Providing shade for your home during summer months can reduce cooling costs by up to 25%.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Energy-Efficient Appliances**: When replacing old appliances, look for ENERGY STAR certified products that use 10-50% less energy than standard models.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Avoid Phantom Load**: Use power strips to easily turn off multiple devices at once, as many electronics continue to draw power even when turned off.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Programmable Settings**: Use programmable thermostats to adjust temperatures automatically based on your schedule.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Schedule Usage**: Run your HVAC system during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower, if applicable.\n",
